  - `Rig` replaced by `MessengerMeta`
- 🟥 obscure renames:
  - `WebSocketTaps` => `DoubleTap`
  - `tap.webSocket` => `tap.websocket`

### v0.5.0-23
- 🟥 lots of renames
  - websocket stuff heavily affected
  - `HttpRpc` -> `Rpc`
  - `asHttpRpc` -> `asRpc`
- 🟥 Messenger's getLocalEndpoint is now async
- 🍏 fixed issue with websocket initialization timings

### v0.5.0-22
- 🍏 add `messenger.remoteEndpoint`

### v0.5.0-21
- 🟥 rework `WindowConduit` to take options instead of positional args
- 🟥 core renames
	- 🟥 `remote` => `makeRemote`
	- 🟥 `endpoint` => `makeEndpoint`
	- 🟥 `mock` => `makeMock`
	- 🟥 `respond` => `execute`
- 🟥 http server and web sockets completely rewritten, see readme
- 🟥 use package.json "exports" feature to auto-export to node and browser
  - `import {} from "@e280/renraku/node"` becomes  
    `import {} from "@e280/renraku"`

### v0.5.0-20
- 🍏 update dependencies

### v0.5.0-19
- 🔶 renraku primitives now default to `ErrorTap`
  - note that `httpServer` defaults to the verbose `LoggerTap`

### v0.5.0-18
- 🟥 rename `AuthWrap` to `Secure`
- 🟥 rename `AuthUnwrap` to `Authorize`

### v0.5.0-17
- 🍏 add new `DudTap` which is a pure tap that does nothing

### v0.5.0-16
- 🍏 fix: mock passes tap to remote

### v0.5.0-15
- 🟥 rename tap's `requestError` to `rpcError`
  - because it's not request specific, it's for errors that happen during the course of an rpc call

### v0.5.0-14
- 🟥 **project moved to `@e280/renraku`**
- 🟥 massive refactor, many such changes, all new readme

---

### v0.5.0-11
- 🟥 `conduit.recv` now requires a 2nd argument `event`
  - is type `ChannelMessage` (requires `data` and `origin`)
  - this allows us to manually jack in and snoop for the `origin` on incoming messages

### v0.5.0-10
- 🟥 WindowConduit now takes a localWindow vs a targetWindow, as apparently we listen for messages on our own window, and post to another

### v0.5.0-9
- 🍏 most conduit subclasses now have a `conduit.dispose()` method to detach event listeners

### v0.5.0-8
- 🟥 rework replace loggers with `logger`, `logger.logcore`, and `logger.logtool` -- see the readme
  - `color` is no longer exported, now we yoink color from `@e280/science`
  - ngl this situation kinda stinks, we really need an official logging lib
- 🟥 rework `Messenger`, which now accepts a new `Conduit`
  - there used to be different kinds of messengers
  - now there's one Messenger class, and multiple kinds of Conduits

### v0.5.0-6
- 🍏 add new `mock` function, which just wraps functions in a remote

### v0.5.0-5
- 🟥 renamed `DeferredPromise` to `DeferPromise` to match slate (it does sound sus tho).
  - also upgraded deferPromise impl to match slate, gained entangle method

### v0.5.0-4
- 🟥 **deleted `PostMessenger`!** it was annoying to upkeep so i chucked it!
  - you gotta switch to using the new `Messenger` now, sorry
- 🟥 change `Bidirectional` to semantically separate `sendRequest` from `sendResponse`.
  - also added a `done` promise to sendRequest params, which enabled advanced integrations.

### v0.5.0-3
- 🟥 rework package `exports` for nodejs
  ```ts
    //    ❌ old bad entrypoint --------.
    //                                   \
  import {WebSocketServer} from "renraku/x/server.js"

    //    ✅ new good entrypoint -------.
    //                                   \
  import {WebSocketServer} from "renraku/node"
  ```
  - previously i actually tried to do the fancy auto environment detection thing, but ts lsp didn't seem to jive with it
  - so now i'm going with a simpler explicit pattern
- 🔶 change messenger portal types, rename `MessageBindables` to `PortalChannel`
- 🍏 add `AsFns` helper type, to keep your fn types honest

### v0.5.0-2
- 🔶 rename `advanced` symbol to `tune`
- 🔶 rename `logistics` symbol to `rig`

### v0.5.0-1
- 🟥 added optional `transfer` argument to Endpoint type
- 🟥 added required `logistics` argument to `Bidirectional->receive`
- 🔶 deprecate `PostMessenger` in favor of new `Messenger`
- 🍏 add new remote fn symbol `advanced` which allows us to specify `transfer` on remote requests
- 🍏 messenger has `logistics` system allowing us to specify `transfer` in local responses

## v0.4

### v0.4.3 — v0.4.5
- 🍏 updated dependencies
- 🍏 fixed proxies for async returns
- 🍏 improved readme

### v0.4.2
- 🍏 isColorSupported accepts env var `FORCE_COLOR`
- 🍏 deathWithDignity now doesn't die on uncaught errors
  -  added option `dieOnUncaught` which you can set `true` if you are a severe person

### v0.4.1
- 🍏 fix efficiency issue in webSocketRemote

### v0.4.0
changes and improvements
- 🍏 added new export `RandomUserEmojis`
- 🟥 revise arguments for `deadline(timeout, message, fn)`
- 🟥 require `onClose` in `webSocketRemote`
- 🟥 in webSocketRemote, rename `fns` to `remote`
  ```ts
  // BAD old way
  const {fns: serverside} = await webSocketRemote<Serverside>(options)

  // GOOD new way
  const {remote: serverside} = await webSocketRemote<Serverside>(options)
  ```

logging and error handling has been revised and greatly improved.
- 🔶 simplified RemoteError constructor to just take a message like ordinary Error
- 🟥 replaced `onInvocation(request, response)` with `onCall(request, remote)`
- 🟥 replaced endpoint `onError` with `onCallError`
- 🟥 replace `PrettyLogger` with `loggers`
  - now you just import `loggers` which is an instance of `Loggers`
  - it attempts to detect if the tty supports ansi colors
  - the loggers instance has ready-made functions `onCall`, `onCallError`, and `onError` for renraku logging
    - these are now the defaults
  - renraku now defaults to logging everything
    - i realized the first thing a developer wants to do, is see that their api is working, and probably start troubleshooting
    - it was just unacceptable to setup renraku and immediately see nothing and be confused and then have a chore to setup logging
    - so now, you can disable logging by passing empty functions for onCall/onCallError/onError
    - i suppose you could actually set those empty functions on the `logger` instance 🤔

## v0.3

### v0.3.0

- 🟥 WebSocketServer `acceptConnection` is now an async function
- 🟥 replaced `expose` function with similar new `endpoint` function
  ```ts
  // OLD -- this is outdated
  new HttpServer(expose(({headers}) => fns))

  // NEW -- do it like this now
  new HttpServer(({headers}) => endpoint(fns))
  ```
  - this new design is cleaner, and non-http apis like postMessage don't need to pretend and pass fake headers like before
  - we also removed the concept of an `Api` type and the `api` helper function
  - if you were using `api`, you are now expected to roll-your-own, like this:
    ```ts
    // OLD
    const myApi = api(({headers}) => ({...myFunctions}))
    new HttpServer(expose(myApi))

    // NEW
    import {ServerMetas} from "renraku"
    const myApi = ({headers}: ServerMetas) => ({...myFunctions})
    new HttpServer(meta => endpoint(myApi(meta)))
    ```
- 🟥 rename `maxPayloadBytes` to `maxRequestBytes`
- 🍏 new `PostMessenger` for bidirectional postmessage apis
- 🍏 add `timeout` for HttpServer and also WebSocketServer, defaults to 10 seconds.
